"""
This is the bluesky dispatcher service that gives interactivity via websockets
to the python script that runs a bluesky plan.

-----------
Motivation:

The intention is that if you can write a standalone python script that executes
a bluesky plan to run a scan and it works at the command line, and you can
pause the scan with CTRL-C, then if you can do the following:

    - modify your script to put your code in a callable function of the
        following signature:

        def my_scan(run_engine, example_param_1=1, example_param_2=2)

    - import this BlueskyDispatcher, instantiate it, pass the instance your scan
        function, and then call its start() method.

you will get:

    - a websocket server listening on port 8765 (can be overridden) that you
        can send websocket messages to in order to enact actions on the run
        engine such as starting a plan and pausing a plan.

    - a websocket server that can be 'subscribed' to in order to receive live
        message updates whenever the state of the RunEngine changes.

    - The ability to create a system where custom scan scripts can be loaded and
        used by users that pass their parameters and control the RunEngine
        through a web interface.

------------------
Technical details:


This is comprised of two distinct threads

The main thread is the thread that runs (executes) the bluesky plan on the
bluesky runengine, I got an error from the bluesky runengine when it was
run once in a thread that wasn't the main thread, however that was before
I instantiated it with an empty list of context_managers which may very
well have fixed its desire to be in the main thread, but whether it was in
the main thread or the newly spawned one made no difference for our
purposes so the main thread is the one that executes the bluesky plan and,

The other thread is the one that serves to listen for requests/commands
from an external source (such as an API service) and to then take the
appropriate actions against the runengine. In this case the other thread
spins up a websocket server coroutine that handles the connections. You
could also do something else like listen to events on a kafka queue or
whatever.

The use of threads was believed to be necessary because the runengine
provides crucial functionality by way of methods you can call such as
request_pause() that allow you to manipulate its behaviour, but when
its in the process of executing a plan it's blocking the thread it's in.
This is why I'm using another thread, instead of another process, to
listen to external events in some way (websockets in this case) and to
take subsequent actions against the same runengine object that is
currently busy with executing a plan.

Given the complexity of this service with respect to threads, any business
logic or UI provisions are envisioned to be implemented in a separate
service that just makes use of this service via the interface it exposes
(in this case, custom websocket message protocols)
Therefore the only thing in this service that should be changed in future
projects should be the instructions around how to perform the scan/experiment.
