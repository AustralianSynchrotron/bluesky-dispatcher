# Bluesky Dispatcher

## History

This repository was started by cherry picking commits from the Australian
Synchrotron's bright-sac-2019 repository.

The bright-sac-2019 repository was for the helical scan demonstration to
showcase the technology stack that would be used on the Synchrotron's
new upcoming beamlines.

BRIGHT: the name of the huge infrastructure project to deliver the
additional beamlines.

SAC: Science Advisory Committee, the group of subject matter experts
recruited to advise the Synchrotron on its BRIGHT developments.

As the work on the helical scan demo progressed, it became evident that
the work being done should be worked on to be easily reused by future
projects. This repository is therefore the extraction of the bluesky
dispatcher component used by and developed by the helical scan project.
